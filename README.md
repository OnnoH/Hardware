# Hardware

As a development environment **PlatformIO IDE** (https://platformio.org) is used,
an extension to Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)

In order to access the devices from a Mac you'll need to install the appropriate drivers. As most of them use the CH340 chipset you can install those following the instructions on this page:

If the board doesn't come with its own USB interface, a USB to serial converter is needed. The Prolific PL2303 is such a device and the drivers (for MacOS) are here:
